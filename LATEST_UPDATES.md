### Consultation CTAs (Updated):
- ✅ "Step Into That Deeper Feeling" (Consult page)
- "Explore That Deeper Feeling" (alternative)
- "Begin Your Journey" (Homepage, About)

### Avoid:

## 💬 QUESTIONS TO CONFIRM

Before building the remaining pages:

1. **Contact Email:** Should contact form submissions go to `hello@thatdeeperfeeling.com` or a different email?

2. **Policies Page:** Do you have existing policy documents (refund policy, confidentiality agreement) I should reference, or should I draft them?

3. **Individual Offering Pages:** Do you want these now, or can they wait? The Offerings hub already shows all 5 containers with pricing and descriptions.

4. **Events Page:** Do you have upcoming Into the Embers dates, or should this be a "Join the Waitlist" page?

---
